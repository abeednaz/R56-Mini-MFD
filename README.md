<h1>R56 MINI Cooper Multi-Functional Display</h1>

My R56 MINI Cooper S is a lovely car, but it is missing a few key instruments from the factory. BMW (in their infinite wisdom) engineered a car with failure-prone plastics in the cooling system, and they opted not to include an engine temperature display for the driver. Instead, there are two warning lights: one for when the coolant temperature exceeds normal operating range, and one for when the engine has already overheated and the all-aluminum engine is toast. There is also a secret menu which can display coolant and oil temperatures in the on-board computer screen in the tachometer, but the menu has to be opened through a special sequence on every drive cycle. 

To give myself a permanent temperature display, I opted to use an ESP32 and an ELM327 OBD-II code scanner in conjunction with an LCD screen.
